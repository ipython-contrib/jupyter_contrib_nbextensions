Changelog
=========

All notable changes to this project should be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres (at least as of 0.3.0!) to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Note also that since this markdown is used to produce our docs at
[jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
via [recommonmark](https://github.com/rtfd/recommonmark), (and GitHub links
aren't automatically added by recommonmark), it'd be helpful if you could
explicitly link github PR/issue numbers and any URIs, to make sure our
readthedocs stuff gets all the shiny link goodness. Thanks!


Unreleased (aka. GitHub master)
-------------------------------

- In *Collapsible Headings*, get the notebook version from `sys_info` if possible, resolving an incompatibility with *notebook* versions 6.5.x [#1617](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1617).
- Add short execution threshold for ExecutionTime plugin. Excution time will not show on cells that executed faster than the given threshold [#1336](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1336).
- Updated verson compatibility for 0.6,x in most extensions, i.e. all that were found working
- Updated toc2.tpl nbconvert template with working CDN links

0.7.0
-----

 - Remove dependency on latex_envs [#1603](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1603)
 - Remove scripts entry in setup.py [#1612](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1612)

0.5.3
-----

- Replace `template_path` with `extra_template_paths` [#1532](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1532). Nbconvert 6.0 replaced `template_path` with `extra_template_paths` (see https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#significant-changes). This change in Nbconvert 6.0 causes errors in jupyter_latex_envs and in jupyter_contrib_nbextensions (see [#1529](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/issues/1529).
- Update `install_requires` list in `setup.py` with 'nbconvert >=6.0' 
- Drop support for python < 3.6
- [toc2] fix for disappearing sidebar in static html_toc export [#1548](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1548)

- Several spelling fixes
- Configure `code_prettify` extension to load custom yapf styles by default [#1376](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1376)

Travis/AppVeyor testing is currently broken due to outdated configuration. Will hopefully be working in 0.5.2 again.
