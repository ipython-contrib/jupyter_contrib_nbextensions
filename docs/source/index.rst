========================================
Non-Official Jupyter Notebook Extensions
========================================

The ``jupyter_notebook_extensions`` package contains a  collection of extensions that add
functionality to the Jupyter notebook. These extensions are mostly written in Javascript and
will be loaded locally in your browser.

The IPython-contrib repository is maintained independently by a group of
users and developers and not officially related to the IPython
development team.

The maturity of the provided extensions varies, so please `create an
issue <https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/issues/new>`__
at the project's `github
repository <https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions>`__
if you encounter any problems.
