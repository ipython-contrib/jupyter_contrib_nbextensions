# Move selected cells

This is a quick (and dirty) extension - move up or down several selected cell*s*. Moving cells or series of cells via simple keystrokes can be super useful.


It is a bit dirty because it would be better to act on DOM elements and write a correct move_cells() function. 

Cautionary note: It is very probable that such functionality will be available shortly in the official Jupyter notebook. But in the meantime, it could be useful to some people. 

Keyboard shortcuts: *Alt-up* and *Alt-down* (works also with single cells!)

**Cell selection**: Cells can be selected using the rubberband (required extension) or via Shift-J and Shift-K
